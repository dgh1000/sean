# concern : how do we represent the word along with an indication of what letters have been guessed?

word = [("a", False), ("n", False), ("i", False)]
word = [("a", True), ("n", False), ("i", True)]
print(word)

print([2*i for i in range(15) if i%2 == 0])
print([t[0] for t in word if t[1] == True])
# x | x <- R, x > 0
